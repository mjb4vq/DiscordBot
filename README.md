# DiscordBot
A very simple Discord bot that responds to user input from a server

DISCLAIMER: There is a Token for this bot, which is intentionally left private. This Token is unique to each and every bot.

This Discord bot simply returns "hi right on back" when a user from a server provides "hi" in a text channel.

Otherwise, the bot simply returns "why don't you greet me?" if any other input is supplied by the user.
